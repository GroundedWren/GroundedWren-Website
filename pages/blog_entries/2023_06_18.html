		<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			I wrote this guide after I legally changed my name in Wisconsin to share with some of my real-life friends who were considering embarking on the process. Later, after I had collected the necessary spoons to use the court order to actually update my name in the various systems of my everyday life, I expanded the guide to include that (surprisingly more difficult) process.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now that I have an honest-to-god blog, I figure it's worth uploading here so that I can just link people who ask instead of passing around a Word document. It's not general use, unfortunately, and will likely only be helpful for folks seeking a name change in Wisconsin, and is only <em>really</em> meant for those in Dane county. Still, it may be a worthwhile read for others who are just looking to get a feel for what this process can entail, whether they are thinking about a name change themselves or just curious about what we have to go through.
		</p>
		<p>
			I would also like to note that this guide provides steps for a legal name change that will be public record, and may even be surfaced with your name in search engines (mine isn't, thankfully). This is something you should absolutely be aware of when beginning the process, and I'd recommend looking into doing your name change
			<a href="https://courts.countyofdane.com/Resources/Forms/other-court-forms#:~:text=Legal%20Name%20Change-,Confidential%20Name%20Change%20Procedure%20for%20an%20Adult%20or%20Minor%2014%20or%20Older%20in%20Dane%20County,-Under%20Wis.%20Stat" target="_blank">confidentially</a> or inquiring with your Clerk's office about unlisting the court record or omitting your new name.
		</p>
		<p>
			Without further ado, here's the guide.
		</p>
		<hr />
		<p>
			Navigating a name change can be stressful and confusing, even with the official instructions and materials in front of you. This guide covers all the steps I took to accomplish a name change here as a trans person, so hopefully others won’t have to re-discover the nuances or be surprised.
		</p>
		<h2 id="NameChangeCourtOrder">
			Name Change Court Order
		</h2>
		<p>
			The first hurdle to updating your legal name is procuring a court order for the change. I am an adult, so I’ll only be covering that specific variation. I was also not born in Wisconsin, so I won’t include information about updating a birth certificate at the same time as getting a court order.
		</p>
		<h3 id="FillingOutTheForms">
			Filling out the Forms
		</h3>
		<p>
			The first thing you’ll want to do is fill out your petition for change of name. This is
			<a href="https://www.wicourts.gov/forms1/circuit/ccform.jsp?FormName=&FormNumber=CV-450&beg_date=&end_date=&StatuteCite=&Category=&Language=&Format=" target="_blank">CV-450</a>. There are instructions on the left side of the document – the form itself is pretty straightforward.
		</p>
		<p>
			There is a blank section on the bottom left of the document – this is where a notary will leave their stamp. To get the document notarized, you should print it out and bring it to a FedEx. I went to
			<a href="https://locations.theupsstore.com/wi/madison/1360-regent-st/notary" target="_blank">this one</a>. You can schedule an appointment online, but it’s probably fine to just walk in. You’ll need your ID.
		</p>
		<p>
			Next up is
			<a href="https://www.wicourts.gov/forms1/circuit/ccform.jsp?FormName=CV-460&FormNumber=&beg_date=&end_date=&StatuteCite=&Category=&Language=&Format=&Submit=Search" target="_blank">CV-460</a>, the Notice and Order for Name Change Hearing. All you really need to do on this one is fill out your name and the county.
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally, fill out
			<a href="https://www.wicourts.gov/forms1/circuit/ccform.jsp?FormName=CV-470&FormNumber=&beg_date=&end_date=&StatuteCite=&Category=&Language=&Format=&Submit=Search" target="_blank">CV-470</a>, the Order for Name Change. All you need to fill out is your name, the county, your address, and your birthday.
		</p>
		<p>
			Some of the literature mentions
			<a href="https://courts.countyofdane.com/documents/Other-Court-Forms/Report-of-Legal-Name-Change-HCF-5021.pdf" target="_blank">HCF 5021</a>, the Report of Legal Name Change. If you weren’t born in Wisconsin, just ignore it. Even if you were, you probably don’t have to bother with it just to change your name.
		</p>
		<p>
			“Why all these different forms with duplicate information,” you may ask. Well, my highly detailed and thoroughly researched answer is this: don’t worry about it.
		</p>
		<h3 id="SubmittingTheForms">Submitting the Forms</h3>
		<p>
			Now, you’ll want to put all your printed documents in a neat little folder and head over to the
			<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Dane+County+Courthouse/@43.0715687,-89.3857394,18.22z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x8806533c01ea1faf:0xe7ea2986d525f87e!8m2!3d43.0712036!4d-89.3840204" target="_blank">Dane County Courthouse</a> at 215 S Hamilton St. If you’re not in walking distance, there’s a public parking garage like a block away. They’re normally open 7:45-4:30, Monday-Friday. I’m not a morning person, so to me those hours are super annoying.
		</p>
		<p>
			There’s some security you’ll need to go through once you arrive. You’ll need to have any bags x-rayed and you’ll go through a metal detector.
		</p>
		<p>
			You want room 1000. It’s on the first floor, to your right after you’ve gone through security. When I was there, staff in the lobby where happy to give directions.
		</p>
		<p>
			Room 1000 is a long room with a bunch of teller windows. It’s a little awkward to queue up in there, but it wasn’t busy when I went. Once you’ve been called up you can just hand the person all your forms – they’ll figure it out.
		</p>
		<p>
			The filing fee is $164.50. I believe they accept check or card, though cards have a small additional fee.
		</p>
		<p>
			You should get a stamped CV-450 back, and a receipt. The person told me that the assigned judge’s office would be in contact with me about the exact date, and to send me the completed CV-460: Notice and Order for Name Change.
		</p>
		<p>
			A quick note here about my experience being transgender in the courthouse: they’re not super awesome about it. I was misgendered at the security checkpoint (I was presenting according to my gender, but I think they saw my ID), and the first thing the person in room 1000 said to me was “So are you getting surgery?”. Not super terrible stuff, but be ready for that.
		</p>
		<p>
			What happens next for you may vary, but by some means you should get communications about scheduling your hearing and get your completed CV-460. In short, if something goes wrong and you don’t get both of these things, call the courthouse at (608)266-4311.
		</p>
		<p>
			I got a call I think a few days later from someone, and we scheduled a date (two months out). I was told to expect an email with CV-460. Later, I received a Notice of Hearing in the mail, but not CV-460, the Notice and Order for Name Change. I had to call about it, and then they emailed it to me.

		<p>
			I’m leaving todayyyyy….
		</p>
		<p>
			But seriously, the next step is to get your name change published in the paper! To do so, you should email the Wisconsin State Journal at
			<a href="mailto:legalmni@madison.com" target="_blank">legalmni@madison.com</a> with your completed CV-460, your current legal name, your phone number, and your address. It costs $85. They’ll want you to pay over the phone with a card, though they will also accept checks in their drop box. For reference, they’re at
			<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/1901+Fish+Hatchery+Rd,+Madison,+WI+53713/@43.044949,-89.4038927,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x8807ad324e9fded9:0xb9285c3e79cfaab9!8m2!3d43.044949!4d-89.401704" target="_blank">1901 Fish Hatchery Road</a>, and their number is (608)250-5630.
		</p>
		<p>
			You’ll need to do this at least three weeks in advance of your hearing. I recommend doing it immediately once you have the completed CV-460.
		</p>
		<p>
			<div class="card right">
				<img src="../../img/Blog/Name Change Notice.png"
					 alt="A newspaper clipping including the case number, prior name, new name, and the date/time/location of the hearing" />
				<footer>
					It'll look like this, but y'know, not all redacted
				</footer>
			</div>
			They should send you a proof, and once you confirm a little notice will print in the classifieds about your hearing once a week.
		</p>
		<p>
			After a couple weeks, the paper will email you a Proof of Publication document. It’ll be notarized (they took care of that for you, how kind). Send this to whomever you’re in contact with inside your assigned judge’s office. If you don’t know who to send this to, call the court and ask.
		</p>
		<p>
			“But Vera, why is this step necessary,” you may be asking. “Certainly, it could jeopardize our safety by outing us to the general public and serves no real purpose,” you may say. “This whole system feels really archaic and silly,” you may think. Look at you, being all critical of the system and making intelligent points.
		</p>
		<h3 id="TheHearing">
			The Hearing
		</h3>
		<p>
			During the pandemic, these are over Zoom! How modern!
		</p>
		<p>
			The materials the court sends you will include the zoom link (in the Notice of Hearing). They’ll also list a courtroom, but that’s fake news. Everyone knows courtrooms are made up for television.
		</p>
		<p>
			The hearing is public, so if anyone wants to watch they can from the court livestream at
			<a href="https://www.wicourts.gov/courts/livestream.htm" , target="_blank">wicourts.gov</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			The hearing is quite easy. The judge will put you under oath (which is a lot of fun) and ask you whether you’re lying to them about anything, but nicely. If nobody hops on the zoom and yells “OBJECTION” then they should sign the petition – it only takes a few minutes in total.
		</p>
		<h3 id="GettingYourDocuments">
			Getting Your Documents
		</h3>
		<p>
			The court reporter should (maybe, possibly) email you after the hearing with further instructions to get copies of your certified order (which you’ll need to update things like your birth certificate and driver’s license). We can’t count on that, though, so here’s what the process is!
		</p>
		<p>
			You will want to stop by the Dane County Clerk of Courts, specifically the Circuit Court Records office. According to the judge at my hearing, they are open “sometimes”. Specifically, that means 7:45 am until 4:30 pm Monday thru Friday, excluding Holidays. Here’s their address:
		</p>
		<div class="centertext-container">
			<div class="centertext card">
				Dane County Courthouse
				<br />Room 1000
				<br />215 S Hamilton St.
				<br />Madison, WI 53703
				<footer><a href="https://courts.countyofdane.com/Resources/Court-Records" target="_blank">Circuit Court Records</a></footer>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>
			They’ll ask you how many certified copies you want. In my experience, when you send an organization a copy they’ll give it back to you, so you probably only want two (for redundancy and parallelization). Not knowing this, I got five. It cost a little money, but not more than $50 (I don’t remember exactly).
		</p>
		<h3 id="Supplimental">
			Supplemental
		</h3>
		<p>
			<a href="https://www.wicourts.gov/formdisplay/CV-490_instructions.pdf?formNumber=CV-490&formType=Instructions&formatId=2&language=en" target="_blank">CV-490</a> is a document with instructions for the name change procedure. You can think of this guide as a kind of CV-490, but better &#128540;.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Wisconsin Court System
			<a href="https://www.wicourts.gov/services/public/selfhelp/namechange.htm" target="_blank">Self-Help Law Center website</a> contains links to a lot of the things I’ve mentioned.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once you’ve turned in your first documents, you’ll have a case number for your court record. You can find a summary of what’s on file at
			<a href="wcca.wicourts.gov" target="_blank">wcca.wicourts.gov</a>. As an example, here’s mine just after my hearing:

			</div>
		</div>
		<h2 id="UpdatingDocuments">
			Updating Documents
		</h2>
		<p>
			Once you have your court order, the state apparatuses should handle updating your name where they store it automatically, right? Wrong! This is America, we’ve got to do that ourselves. Freedom!
		</p>
		<p>
			The one good part of having to update your legal name manually with a bunch of different organizations is that you might be able to bundle a legal sex change in at the same time, which is what I did. This guide will include that.
		</p>
		<p>
			I did these things in the order listed and would recommend that order unless the process for updating a birth certificate is substantially different from that of Illinois.
		</p>
		<h3 id="IllinoisBirthCertificate">
			Illinois Birth Certificate
		</h3>
		<p>
			This process is different by state with varying standards for what they’ll accept to update your legal sex, because of course. Illinois isn’t too bad, though – I tackled this part first.
		</p>
		<p>
			To amend your Illinois birth certificate, you’ll need to work with the Illinois Department of Public Health, or IDPH. Here's
			<a href="https://dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/birth-death-other-records/birth-records.html" target="_blank">some information they have on the process</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Basically, you need to give them five things via mail.
			<ul>
				<li>
					A signed and notarized <a href="https://dph.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/idph/files/forms/formsoppsaffidavitcertificatecorrectionre.pdf" target="_blank">STATE OF ILLINOIS AFFIDAVIT AND CERTIFICATE OF CORRECTION REQUEST</a>.
					<br />Again, I used <a href="https://locations.theupsstore.com/wi/madison/1360-regent-st/notary" target="_blank">this notary</a>. If you’re changing your legal sex at the same time, you’ll need to include it in this document, in the “SECOND; the following information is incorrect or missing and should be corrected as follows” section. In the “What you want corrected” column, put “Child’s Legal First Name” to update your name, and “Child’s Sex” to update your legal sex.
				</li>
				<li>
					A $15 check or money order made payable to Illinois Department of Public Health, because god forbid our taxes pay for any of this.
				</li>
				<li>
					A <a href="https://dph.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/idph/files/forms/gender-reassignment-2017.pdf" target="_blank">Declaration of Gender Transition or Intersex Condition</a> form.
					<br />You’ll need to bring this to a doctor who has done gender-affirming care for you, or a therapist, to sign. <strong>You will need to send the original copy physically signed by pen; they are very particular about this.</strong> They will not take a digital signature or a scanned copy.
					<br />Otherwise, the standards on this form are very low – you just need to have “undergone treatment that is clinically appropriate for the purpose of gender transition, based on contemporary medical standards”, which is basically at your doctor’s discretion.
				</li>
				<li>
					A scanned copy of your driver’s license – this does NOT need to be updated with your new name or sex.
				</li>
				<li>
					A certified copy of Signed CV-470 – Order for Name Change.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			You want to send these things here:
		</p>
		<div class="centertext-container">
			<div class="centertext card">
				Illinois Department of Public Health
				<br />Division of Vital Records
				<br />925 E. Ridgely Ave.
				<br />Springfield, IL 62702-2737
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>
			They should get back to you in a couple weeks with your updated birth certificate &#128522;
		</p>
		<h3 id="SocialSecurityAdministration">
			Social Security Administration
		</h3>
		<p>
			Social security cards cannot be requested online if they include a name change – it must be done through a local office by mail. Here’s
			<a href="https://faq.ssa.gov/en-us/Topic/article/KA-01981" target="_blank">their webpage on the matter</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			The local Social Security Office (SSO) is:
		</p>
		<div class="centertext-container">
			<div class="centertext card">
				6011 ODANA RD
				<br />MADISON, WI 53719
				<br />1-866-770-2262
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>
			You will need to mail them the following things:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				The SS-5 Document – “<a href="https://www.ssa.gov/forms/ss-5.pdf" target="_blank">Application for a Social Security Card</a>”.
				<br />The form is pretty straightforward. Field 8 asks you to choose your sex as male or female – if you are updating your legal sex at the same time you should put your new sex. I don’t know what the process is for people whose sex is not male or female.
			</li>
			<li>
				An original identity document, probably your driver’s license or passport. It is not necessary to have your name or sex updated on these forms. It’s scary to send the actual physical ID, yes, but they’ll send it back in a few days.
			</li>
			<li>
				If you are changing your legal sex with this application, you need <strong>one</strong> of the following:
				<ul>
					<li>
						10-year passport with your updated gender marker.
					</li>
					<li>
						Certified State-issued amended birth certificate with your updated gender marker.
					</li>
					<li>
						Certified copy of a Court Order for Gender Marker Change (not sure what this is, I don’t think Wisconsin does that).
					</li>
					<li>
						Medical certification of “appropriate clinical treatment”
						<br />This one is the easiest and has a lower standard than WI’s requirement of surgery. Their <a href="https://transequality.org/know-your-rights/social-security" target="_blank">procedure webpage</a> has an example of what this will look like – talk to your doctor.
						<br />I was able to use my IDPH Declaration of Gender Transition or Intersex Condition document from updating my birth certificate for this.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				A Certified Copy of Signed CV-470 – Order for Name Change.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			It will be about a month before you get your new Social Security card in the mail.
		</p>
		<h3 id="DriversLicense">
			Driver's License
		</h3>
		<p>
			Here’s the
			<a href="https://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/dmv/license-drvs/rnew-and-chge/name-change.aspx" target="_blank">WI Department of Transportation’s webpage on the matte</a>r. In order to do this, you need to first update your name with the Social Security Administration (see the previous section). You’ll need to wait 48 hours from when the SSA confirms your information has updated to make sure the DMV is able to verify the information.
		</p>
		<p>
			You need to do this <a href="https://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/online-srvcs/find-dmv/default.aspx" target="_blank">in person</a>. You will need to bring:
			<ul>
				<li>
					Form MV3001 – “<a href="https://wisconsindot.gov/Documents/formdocs/mv3001.pdf" target="_blank">Wisconsin Driver License Application</a>”.
					<br />Put your new name as the applicant name, and your new sex if that’s also updated with the SSA.
					<br />For “Reason for Name Change”, I put “Gender Transition”. In the current political climate, I would actually recommend putting something more generic like "personal preference".
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="https://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/dmv/license-drvs/how-to-apply/identity.aspx" target="_blank">Proof of Identity</a>. Lots of things qualify for this – see the webpage. Bring multiple!
					<br />This is a good opportunity to get your <a href="https://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/dmv/license-drvs/how-to-apply/realid.aspx" target="_blank">REAL ID</a>!
				</li>
				<li>
					34 cold, hard American dollars.
				</li>
				<li>
					Your old Driver’s License.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			I went to Madison West Service Center – they’re pretty great. They’re open from 8:30 am to 4:45 pm Monday thru Friday.

		</h3>
		<p>
			Here’s the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/have-passport/change-correct.html" target="_blank">Department of State's website on the matter</a>. You need to apply in person. Here are the steps:
			<ol>
				<li>
					Fill out form <a href="https://eforms.state.gov/Forms/ds11.pdf" target="_blank">DS-11</a>. I recommend using the <a href="https://pptform.state.gov/" target="_blank">form-filler</a> that the gov’t website provides.
					<br />Put your updated name and sex on this document.
				</li>
				<li>
					Gather evidence of US Citizenship. This can be your Birth Certificate, or old passport. Make a photocopy of this.
				</li>
				<li>
					Gather your Photo ID – probably a driver’s license. Make a photocopy of this.
				</li>
				<li>
					Your <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply/fees.html" target="_blank">fee for a new passport</a> is probably $130. Write a check payable to the U.S. Department of State. There’s probably an additional $35 you need to pay to the acceptance facility.
				</li>
				<li>
					You need to provide a photo. I recommend just going to a post office that will take a photo for you so you won’t have any compliance issues. It’ll probably cost $15.
				</li>
				<li>
					They may not ask for a Certified Copy of Signed CV-470 – Order for Name Change, but you sure need it (I got a letter asking for it after submitting my application). I’d bring one.
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="https://iafdb.travel.state.gov/" target="_blank">Make an appointment</a>. I went to the Southside Station Post Office, where they do photos on-site.
				</li>
				<li>
					Go to your appointment and smile big if they let you!
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p>
			Your application can thereafter be <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/need-passport/status.html" target="_blank">tracked online</a>. It'll take 1-2 months to complete.
