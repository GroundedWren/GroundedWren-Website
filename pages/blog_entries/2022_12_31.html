	<p>
		If asked to think of a bird, I have little doubt I would instinctively conjure memories of Sally, a parakeet I cared for as a child. I would think about her sitting on my finger while I rubbed her belly, about how fast her little heart seemed to beat, about her beautiful yet constant chirping, and certainly about chasing her around the house as she flew, just out of reach, from perch to perch. She was a wonderful bird who my parents gave me after I had spent months fascinated with all things avian, not so subtly pouring over manuals on bird ownership. Birds are wonderful, complex things and, if the name of this website is any indication, my love for them has persisted into adulthood.
	</p>
	<p>
		If asked to provide the primary defining feature of birds, I’d wager most people would say the same thing. What do birds do? Birds fly. It’s their preeminent cultural association used in dozens of sayings and metaphors. After a moment of thought though, it should be obvious that not all birds are, as Bob Dylan put it, chained to the sky. Many domesticated birds like chickens can only sort-of fly, in their own limited way. Others have had flight selectively bread out of them completely, like the Broad Breasted White turkey, a breed which is so thoroughly and efficiently exploited by Humans that they are impossible not to pity.
	</p>
	<p>
		Flightlessness isn’t just somethings Humans impose on birds, though, many species are naturally flightless. The most obvious and well-known examples are probably penguins and ostriches, but there are many more, particularly in island archipelagos in the absence of mammals. There, absent major land-based predators to evade, birds can evolve to fill a mammal-like terrestrial niche and thrive.
	</p>
	<p>
		With this in mind, an answer to the ostensibly easy question “what is a bird”, grows a little more elusive. If not all birds share the trait that many would consider their signature, how can we coherently construct the label? For this, we turn to the wonderful world of phylogenetics and evolutionary biology.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is well known that birds are descended from dinosaurs and have their own taxon, Aves. Until the most recent turn of the century, the predominant definition of the class included the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of modern birds and Archaeopteryx, a genus meaning “old-wing” which was considered to contain the earliest birds. However, in the 21st century this definition has been largely replaced by a new one proposed by the systematist Jacques Gauthier, who in 2001 pointed out that four inconsistent definitions of “Aves” were in use in biology. His proposal sets the definition for Aves as the collection of species of living birds, their most recent common ancestor, and all descendants of that ancestor – this is called a Crown group. This definition relegates most groups extinct before being known by humans, including Archaeopteryx, to a newly defined clad called Avialae. However, this clad is often used synonymously with the vernacular term, “bird”, by researchers.
	</p>
	<p>
		While phylogenetics is not my field, I don’t think I’m unjustified in saying that this is complicated. Certainly, the answer to “what is a bird” must be more nuanced than three words, for example.

	<p>
		In Passeriformes (perching birds), flightlessness has been referred to as a rare apomorphy. However, when determining how rare this trait really is, it is important to not overlook how Humans have impacted the things they are observing by being there to observe them. Anthropogenic extinctions are well-known and sadly common, but what is perhaps less well-known is how we’re disproportionately killing certain types of species, and how that might color our understanding of the world and of evolution itself. In the 2020 paper, <i>Anthropogenic extinctions conceal widespread evolution of flightlessness in birds</i>, Sayol et al explain:
	</p>
	<div class="card center">
		"One trait where this distortion could be particularly acute is flightlessness, the evolution of which renders species more vulnerable to hunting by humans and predation by human-introduced, non-native species such as rats and cats."
	</div>
	<p>
		In an attempt to correct for Human-driven extinction, the paper concludes:
	</p>
	<div class="card center">
		“Flightlessness was far more phylogenetically and geographically widespread before human impacts . . .. It was common in many of the island archipelagos . . . with remarkable hotspots in Hawaii (23 species) and New Zealand (26 species), including giant flightless geese and moa, respectively”
	</div>
	<p>
		Let’s take a closer look at one such case which is particularly tragic, the end of the only known flightless songbirds in the world.
	</p>

	<h2>The Extinction of Lyall's Wren</h2>

	<p>
		Referring to the recent discovery of Saddle-back and South Island Thrush on a tiny island at the tip of the Marlborough Sounds, Sir Walter Buller, a leading ornithology figure in New Zealand, addressed the Wellington Philosophical Society in 1893:
	</p>
	<div class="card center">
		“. . . it is to be hoped that these small island sanctuaries will be the means of preserving many of these rare forms.”
	</div>
	<div class="card right" style="width: 15%">
		<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Aaron_Paul.jpg" />

	</div>
	<p>
		However, this particular island was not to be made a sanctuary at the time. The following year construction finished on a very expensive oil-based lighthouse on the island, bringing with it three keepers, their families, and a cat called Tibbles.
	</p>
	<p>
		The island, known by the indigenous Māori as Takapourewa but later renamed Stephens Island by explorer Captain Cook in 1770, had never known mammals and was mostly undisturbed by Humans before the construction of the lighthouse. It was home to a tiny species of flightless bird which would come to be known as Traversia lyalli, or Lyall’s Wren. They existed nowhere else in the world.
	</p>
	<p>
		David Lyall, an assistant keeper of the lighthouse, may have been the first Human to lay eyes on the wren when Tibbles brought one she had hunted to his door around July 1894. Intrigued, Lyall gave the skin of the bird to a Q.W. Bethune, the second engineer of the <i>Hinemoa</i> there on a supply run, who was known to collect specimens of rare birds on the Cook Strait islands for Sir Walter Buller. Buller, who planned to publish a description of the new species in the British journal <i>Ibis</i>, described receiving the specimens in 1896 before the Wellington Philosophical Society:
	</p>
	<div class="card center">
		“There is probably nothing so refreshing to the soul of a naturalist as the discovery of a new species. You will readily understand, therefore, how pleased I was at receiving, through the kind offices of Mr. Bethune, the skin of a bird from Stephen Island which was entirely distinct from anything hitherto known.”
	</div>
	<p>
		However, Buller was not the only figure in ornithology clued into the existence of the wrens. Henry H. Travers, who wrote under the mysterious pseudonym “The Collector”, visited the island and also received specimens from Lyall. Seeking a better price than what Buller was likely to provide, he sold the deceased birds to Lord Walter Rothschild who operated a private museum in Tring, Hertfordshire at the time. Travers wrote to Rothschild in October 1894:
	</p>
	<div class="card right" style="width: 15%">

		<footer>József Árpád Koppay, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons</footer>
	</div>
	<div class="card center">
		“I shall be glad if you will cause the name of Mr. D. Lyall, Lighthouse Keeper Stephens Island, to be mentioned as the discoverer, & that it was forwarded to you by me”
	</div>
	<p>
		Rothschild rushed a paper to print for the British Ornithologist’s Club that December, snubbing Buller’s paper which was already in the works but wouldn’t appear until the following April. The men were a bit sour at each other about the whole thing for years afterwards.
	</p>
	<p>
		As early as 1895, Lyall believed the species to have gone extinct, as he and Travers were searching for further specimens to sell to both Buller and Rothschild. The news broke very quickly; an editorial appeared in Christchurch’s <i>Press</i> in March 1895 suggesting the bird was already extinct. From that editorial:
	</p>
	<div class="card center">
		“There is very good reason to believe that the bird is no longer to be found on the island, and, as it is not known to exist anywhere else, it has apparently become quite extinct. This is probably a record performance in the way of extermination. The English scientific world will hear almost simultaneously of the bird’s discovery and its disappearance before anything is known of its lifehistory or its habits.”
	</div>
	<p>
		Indeed, very little was known about the birds by the time they became extinct. It was not even certain that they were flightless until it was confirmed by skeletal evidence in 1989. A testament to Human failure, the species has been reduced to 15 known deceased specimens scattered across a number of museums.
	</p>
	<p>
		Rothschild popularized the myth that Tibbles was solely responsible for the destruction of Traversia lyalli, but the truth, while perhaps less dramatic, is notably sadder. According to Travers, Lyall, and others, the island was “swarming with cats” (Travers to Hector 27 December 1898). From that same account, Travers asserts that cats came to the island accidentally after a pregnant cat, who was planned to be tossed overboard a ship, was not due to inclement weather and was instead released onto Stephens Island. Later, a bounty was placed on the island’s cats in order to eliminate them, but this was not fully accomplished until around 1925. Carelessness and cruelty define this story from start to end.
	</p>
	<h2>Flightless Birds in Metaphor</h2>
	<p>
		Given the cultural association of birds and flight, it is interesting to examine how birds which cannot fly are regarded. A number of songs I know and love invoke flightless birds – let’s examine how they are used.
	</p>
	<div class="card right">
		<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Sam_Beam.jpg" />
		<footer>Sam Beam</footer>

	</div>
	<p>
		The concept is featured prominently in the title of one of the most well-known songs by Iron & Wine, <i>Flightless Bird, American Mouth</i>. The song, originally penned and recorded by Sam Beam in 2004, is about American identity and lost innocence. Sam describes writing the song at a time he was coming to terms with histories he had learned about the country in the disillusionment which followed the September 11 terrorist attacks.
	</p>
	<div class="card center">
		“It's me talking to America and describing our relationship . . . I was reacting to this difference between the myth and the reality.”
	</div>
	<p>
		The song begins with the innocent imagery of a young boy playing with toys and “diving too deep” for coins. The act of diving too deep, which Sam describes as a metaphor for introspection, drives the song in the direction of turmoil and frustration as it goes along.
	</p>
	<div class="card center">
		“Have I found you? / Flightless bird, jealous, weeping / Or lost you? / American mouth / Big pill looming”.
	</div>
	<p>
		Here, a flightless bird is juxtaposed with an image of a mouth swallowing a pill to highlight the tension of what Sam had idealized about America and what he was coming to accept. "And then once I got to the idea of like, America being a mouth, the rest kind of felt like, that things are going wrong."
	</p>
	<p>
		There is also an identity struggle at the core of the song. Sam describes himself as being caught between the flightless bird and the American mouth, both in his outlook, and, I imagine, how he sees his role as an American. To what degree is he the consuming mouth, complicit in the harm done to the “grounded, bleeding” bird?
	</p>
	<p>
		In some accidental connection to the extinction of Lyall’s Wren, the song includes lines describing the narrator as having become a cat, and particularly calling out its tongue (related to being the mouth).
	</p>
	<p>
		The song was popularized by its usage in the film <i>Twilight</i>, released in 2008 and one of its sequels, <i>Breaking Dawn</i> in 2011 during a prom dance and a wedding, respectively. This application of the song reframes the flightless bird as perhaps romance itself, delicate, precious, but vulnerable.
	</p>
	<p>
		Iron & Wine uses flightless birds or birds rendered flightless not infrequently in their other songs, commonly framed as representing victimhood or oppression.
	</p>
	<div class="card center">
		“There are castles for kings / There are birds without wings / I could whine 'bout it all / But I won't”

	</div>
	<div class="card center">
		“Sons can be birds taken broken up to the mountain”
		<footer>Upward Over the Mountain</footer>
	</div>
	<div class="card center">
		“I saw sunlight on the water / Saw a bird fall like a hammer from the sky”
		<footer>Walking Far From Home</footer>
	</div>
	<p>
		This is not inconsistent with another famous usage of a flightless bird in the song <i>Polly</i>, by Nirvana. <i>Polly</i>, told from the perspective of a rapist, describes clipping a bird’s wings.
	</p>

	<h2>What We're Really Talking About Here</h2>
	<p>
		In 2022 The Daily Wire released <i>What is a Woman</i>, a transphobic documentary narrated by Matt Walsh. The film features its eponymous question being posed to numerous people, most of whom struggle to provide a trans-inclusive answer which is satisfactorily simple to Walsh. The film concludes with Walsh’s wife ostensibly providing the correct, three-word answer: “adult human female”, a phrase popularized by the so-called “Gender Critical” reactionary movement.
	</p>
	<p>
		The film, which appealed to the right-wing conflation of simplicity and truth, found a broad audience. According to Ben Shapiro on the <i>Post-Gazette</i>:
	</p>
	<div class="card center">
		“The film has been the single largest success in the history of The Daily Wire; hundreds of thousands of Americans have subscribed to view it”
	</div>
	<p>
		The film premiered the same year Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton requested that the Department of Public Safety compile a list of people who had updated their gender displayed on their driver’s license in the last two years. The request reportedly bypassed normal channels and has been denied by the AG’s office. This measure is only the latest and most chilling in a long line of anti-transgender moves made nationwide by policymakers.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Gender Critical reactionary movement also asserts that being transgender is a new phenomenon which has not occurred throughout history and is therefore aberrant and propagated by social contagion. This assertion comes without considering historical context for gender-expansive identities - that they aren’t truly new, and that where they did arise, they were largely suppressed.
	</p>
	<p>
		The parallels to bird taxonomy, distorted understanding of naturally evolved flightlessness, and vulnerability to neglect and cruelty are hopefully plain. With this in mind, let’s apply a new lens to flightless birds in metaphor.
	</p>

	<h2>Flightless Birds in Metaphor - Revisited</h2>
	<p>
		Looking again at Iron & Wine’s <i>Flightless Bird, American Mouth</i>, the same basic conflict may be carried forward into a queer reading, but some of the particulars afford different interpretation. For example, the “diving too deep” introspection in the first verse may denote the realization of a queer identity, or that a known queer identity is othered or not accepted. This fits nicely into another part of that verse, “All of your streetlight eyes / Wide on my plastic toys”, which indicates an awareness that the narrator is being watched carefully, even scrutinized, particularly in their play. If they are not engaging in gender-normative play, that is something which may be noticed and “corrected”.
	</p>
	<p>
		The tension of being stuck between the flightless bird and the American mouth, between the victim and victimizer, also lends new interpretation. Queer people are still of their culture, and participation therein can drive them to act against themselves and those like them. A surprising number of anti-LGBT activists have been revealed to engage in homosexual behavior, for example. They let themselves be the American mouth.
	</p>
	<p>
		In some capacity or another, most everyone ends up being the American mouth, even unintentionally. This is the nature of existing in society as it is today – simply by taking up space you’re likely to be hurting someone. Similarly, most all of us are in some way flightless, jealous, weeping, and bleeding, again simply as a feature of being alive. As Sam laments being stuck between the flightless bird and the American mouth, so are we all.
	</p>

	</div>
	<p>
		Another song featuring flightless birds is a bit more disturbing in this context. The first verse of <i>Spare-Ohs</i> by Andrew Bird goes:
	</p>
	<div class="card center">
		“The finches and sparrows build nests in my chimney / With what remains of the small flightless birds that you failed to protect / … / And they’re crop-dusting gardens all over this town”
	</div>
	<p>
		And in the second verse:
	</p>
	<div class="card center">
		“But nobody cares when it gets in their hair / It gets in their lungs as it floats through the air / It gets in the food that they buy and prepare / But nobody cares when it gets in their hair”
	</div>
	<p>
		In this song, the worst has happened. As on Stephens Island, the flightless birds have been killed by Human failure, and now their ashes are spreading over an apathetic town. The Holocaust imagery is undeniable – so as the birds’ ashes are getting in everything, so too did the possessions and remains of those exterminated become exploited as consumer goods in the Nazi regime. The primary victims of The Holocaust were Jewish people, of course, but also targeted were queer people, the disabled, and other vulnerable populations.
	</p>
	<p>
		<i>Spare-Ohs</i> goes on to tell us to resist accepting this evil as natural or inevitable.
	</p>
	<div class="card center">
		“Oh, don’t tell me that it just isn’t fair / Don’t speak about the cycles of life / ‘Cause your thoughts are so soft I could cut ‘em with a spork, or a bride’s knife”
	</div>
	<p>
		It’s an extremely worthwhile message and timely warning.
	</p>

	<h2>Flightless Birds are Birds, Volant Mammals are Mammals</h2>
	<p>
		It is my hope that with these parallels drawn that other queer folk can draw string from and find kinship in the idea of the flightless bird, and that we can each acknowledge and resist our American mouths. I’ll end here with the second verse and chorus of <i>The Truest Stars We Know</i> by Iron & Wine.
	</p>
	<div class="card center">
		Someone has the door to Heaven, someone has the lock / Someone has to be the dove when someone is the hawk / And someone’s talking to the miles around and hearing them for good / Everybody’s branch is falling harder than they should
	</div>
	<div class="card center">
		“And I know Jesus and his trophy wives / Are praying for the broken to be noticed / Save us all from what we want / Beautiful and beaten back to life”
	</div>
