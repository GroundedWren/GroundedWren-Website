        <h2>Waking up</h2>
        <p>
            Waking up can be a scary thing. For me, realizing that I’ve become awake is usually a gradual process. I often snooze my alarm multiple times and don’t remember doing so, even though I had to be conscious enough to realize the alarm was going off, find my phone (which is frequently knocked onto the floor), and flick the impossible to see slider in the correct direction. Sometimes I’ll find myself lost in thought, caught between alert musings and outright dreams, only slowly becoming aware that it’s morning and that I’ve awoken. Sometimes, terrifyingly, I’ll outright imagine waking up, getting ready, and having conversations, only to realize I’m still in bed. I’m sure these circadian peculiarities sound familiar to most people. The most troubling experiences I’ve had, though, are when I’ve gained enough consciousness to be aware of my surroundings, but not enough to remember the context of my life.

            It’s easy to forget just how much of your life you spend staring at ceilings. In my often-restless youth, I spent many low-light hours studying the ceilings of my various rooms, imagining constellations in vermiculite flecks or being hypnotized by the rhythmic humming of a fan. As a child, I felt much closer and more intimate with my physical surroundings than I do now, and the bedroom ceilings of our various dwellings were no different.

        <p>
            When jarred from sleep and just conscious enough for raw perception, I again feel that level of closeness with my room. Without the haze of the everyday, I notice things I otherwise wouldn’t. I hear each particular of the ambient house-sounds, I see how the morning light is patterned against my tapestries, and I see my overhead light as a real, physical thing instead of an abstraction. In this state, memories of my previous bedrooms are the first things to come crashing forward out of the neuron sea, having been tucked away deep beneath where my standard perceptions probe. I look around my room and I wonder, which one is this? Which of the associated emotional palettes being de-iced is currently in use? It’s scary to not know, but it does connect me to all of those previous selves, those younger women and girls; realizing I could be any of them implies I am all of them.

        <h2>Looking back</h2>
        <p>
            I’ve always struggled to answer the question “where are you from?” I know that the answer for many people is not literally singular, and I am definitely no exception, but I also struggle to answer the intended question: “where is home to you?”
        </p>
        <p>
            My first instinct in answering this question is to point to the place where I have continually lived the longest, a buzzing tourist town high in the Rocky Mountains. And it’s true, I’m very familiar with that town; I used to imagine that I could be dropped on any street and find my way home as a kid. I remember how the dry air felt in my nose, I remember the crunchy, scraggly grass and the beautiful deep blue skies so much nearer to space. I remember our family home there – three generations on as many floors. I remember the carpets and their burns, the tiles and their coolness, the garage and its staleness. I remember, and deeply miss, the sound of my grandparents’ voices even as their faces fade from me. I remember the laughter and the bitter cold, the delicious food and the howling wind, the imaginative play and the petty squabbles. It is a good place. It is a home.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another instinct I have is to point to where I struggled through adolescence, the forested cosmopolitan heart of Northern Virginia. I remember all the time outside riding bikes through falling leaves, and I remember all the time inside huddled around split-screen video games. I remember the stress and the pressure of school and how seriously I took it, and I remember the delicious Korean baked goods and shaved ice. I remember the strain and euphoria of long afternoons exercising with the crew team, and I remember the serenity and odd melancholy of running through neighborhoods at dusk with the track team. I remember finding my people in the school bands, on the floors of the hallways at lunch, and in the computer labs. I remember the shame in developing my sexuality and the half-assed obligatory crushes I felt compelled to have. I remember my body changing and growing into something I didn’t really recognize. What I remember less is a particular house or any meaningful details of the two places we resided beyond the sort of thing I remember from more transient residences. Still, it is a good place, though it may not be home.
        </p>
        <p>
            I think the most honest answer, though, is that my home is in an ancient little house in a dying town among the great, flat swaths of Illinois cornfields. It was here I formed the deepest, most subconscious memories my young mind ever produced, and it was to here I would keep returning for decades after all my other homes had passed away. It was my grandmother’s home.
        </p>
        <p>
            I will never, ever forget the nights spent in her little attic bedroom with my entire immediate family. Memories of the creaking wooden floors, the old-fashioned drapes on the rattling, warped windows, and the silhouettes of dead ladybugs piled between the glass of the overhead light and the ceiling are as much a part of me as my bones. My little bed sat on the floor at the top of the attic’s treacherous stairway; at night, the descent would fade to black before the door, and I would stare down into it as though monsters wouldn’t come if I was watching. I remember long nights in that bed listening to the rain and the cicadas accompanied occasionally by a muted train horn from the tracks which ran through the center of town. I remember watching Star Trek on my grandma’s tiny little bedroom television for hours while the sun was too hot. I remember mom reading to us from the Diary of Anne Frank, my first time reading Shakespeare, and the smell of old drawing paper from some ancient piece of my grandma’s furniture I cannot name. I remember climbing the trees which are no longer there, picking raspberries from a now torn-out bush, and painting an old shed which is now ash. I remember all this and so much more. It is a deeply good place, and it always seems to come back to me first as I wake up. It is my home.
