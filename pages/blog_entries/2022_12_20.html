        <p>Hey there :)</p>
        <p>
            I have just stayed up until 2 in the morning putting this blog page together. I didn't do it how I originally planned, but
            I think I chose a pretty good way - having each blog entry be its own full HTML page means I can do any kind of markup I like,
            and just hosting the entry in an iframe means I don't have to mess with loading or parsing files. I was looking at the fetch
            API to see how to do that, but I suppose I don't have to make fetch happen after all.
        </p>
        <p>
            This will be a short entry seeing as it's 2am on a <s>Tuesday</s> Wednesday and my brain is mush from trying to
            understand prototypal inheritance and how "this" gets set in javascript. These are things I've looked into before, but they
            never seem to stick due to how <em>fucking weird</em> they are. I also stayed at work until, I think it was 9:30? I didn't
            work nonstop, but I did feel compelled to finish a nightmare of a bug fix which has been haunting my very soul for weeks.
            Hopefully, I've gotten it behind me now.
        </p>
        <p>
            I think that's about it. I'm going to go to bed now. Good night, blog!
