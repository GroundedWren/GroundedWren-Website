			I’d heard the term “bisexual lesbian” in passing several times in the months before I finally stopped to look it up; I think I waited so long because it was a phrase which was just over the threshold where confusion surpasses curiosity and I dismissed it out of hand as meaningless. After all, it is a union of terms which nominally describe mutually exclusive groups, right? The words can be a bit murky regarding those who don’t have binary gender, but bisexuals are attracted to men while lesbians cannot be attracted to men, so what gives?
		</p>
		<h3 id="TheControversy">The Controversy</h3>
		<p>
			My confused reaction appears common to those new to the term, but what has cemented “bisexual lesbian” as a perennial topic in online discussion isn’t confusion, it’s directed backlash against what the dual employment of these labels <em>does</em> or <em>might do</em>. The following are excerpts from an (annoyingly fragmented) thread purporting to explain what bi lesbians are and why they’re harmful.

			Boiled down to base, the objection is that “bi lesbian” weakens the boundary between “bisexual” and “lesbian”, watering down the meaning of each. At a glance this makes sense, but it does raise the question of why it’s important for there to be a hard division between bisexual women and lesbians. Certainly, the experiences of bisexual women and lesbians will have some general differences; I can personally attest that the bisexual experience of growing up attracted to both women and men absent the knowledge that this is possible is profoundly confusing, for example, but politically and socially we inhabit the same space. Are people who use both labels really going to be so disruptive?

			This calls into question the motivations of vocal opponents to the “bi lesbian” label. Typically, those who aim to segregate communities of queer people from each other either really don’t like one of the groups and want to exclude them (see
			<a href="https://www.autostraddle.com/gold-star-lesbian-definition/" target="_blank">gold star lesbians</a> and the insistence that
			<a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2016/05/over-80-percent-of-bisexuals-end-up-in-straight-relationships-why.html" target="_blank">bi women are usually just straight</a>), or they’re employing a “divide and conquer” strategy against both. In fact, the reframing of the term “lesbian” to mean exclusively homosexual women (as opposed to an umbrella term for
			<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/WLW" target="_blank">wlw</a> like sapphic) has ties to the
			<a href="https://encyclopedia.pub/entry/31571#:~:text=%5B3%5D-,2.%20Lesbian%20Separatism,-Lesbian%20separatism%20is" target="_blank">Lesbian Separatist movement</a> of the 1970s which was explicitly exclusionary and overtly resentful of bisexual women. Intentions aside, insistence on strict labels for people is an inherently conservative position, relatively speaking, and one that we should be careful of.
		</p>
		<p>
			For many who are newly coming to understand their own queerness, it can be a long process to figure out the precise shape of their own identity, a process which for many is never truly complete. In this time they may mingle with various queer sub-groups trying to get a feel for each and searching for a community where they can truly belong. If someone’s understanding of their identity shifts after they have laid down roots, a strictly-enforced label-centric approach to community might dictate that they uproot themselves from possibly the only group which has welcomed them as their authentic self.

			Pushing this tendency to the extreme was the
			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBOmffiWss0" target="_blank">MOGAI</a> (Marginalized Orientations Gender Alignments Intersex) movement of the mid 2010s which generated a massive number of
			<a href="https://www.lgbtqia.wiki/wiki/Geuldrin" target="_blank">extremely specific identities</a> which have very little history and might only be in use by a handful of people or even just one person. This movement was highly detrimental to community building among young queer people and made worse the already severe lack of knowledge of queer history among modern youth.
		</p>
		<p>
			Well and good as these critiques of opposition to the “bi lesbian” label may be, does the label make any sense? It actually does, multiple ways. First, let’s talk about the split attraction model.

		<p>
			Originated by the asexual (or ace-spec) community, the
			<a href="https://www.gsrc.princeton.edu/split-attraction" target="_blank">split attraction model</a> gives form to the nuance of interpersonal attraction. While it is intuitive that romantic interest and physical lust are not exactly the same thing, the split attraction model asserts that they can be entirely decoupled in many cases. Just as a person might not be romantically interested in everyone they are physically attracted to, they might well feel romantic and physical attraction to entirely different sets of people, or they might not experience one kind of attraction at all.
		</p>
		<p>
			Applying this model to bi lesbians, it’s clear that the term is coherent if “bi” applies to one mode of attraction and “lesbian” to the other. For example, using more precise terminology, a woman who is romantically attracted to people of all genders while being physically interested exclusively in women could be called “biromantic homosexual”, i.e. a “bi lesbian”.

				"Many communities are united by a commonality of the oppression. This is not so in our community, partly because of the different ways people identify as bisexual: gay-identified, queer-identified, lesbian-identified, or heterosexual-identified. Some people are bisexual in an affectional manner only; some are bisexual both affectionally and sexually; and some are bisexual only sexually. Since there are so many ways to express our bisexuality, the first step toward alliance-building is to work internally to accept all members of our own community. It is imperative that we build alliances across our own differences; otherwise, alliance-building will fail."

		</div>
		<p>
			As soon as I was reminded of the split attraction model in this context, I was immediately on board with the label. It does unfortunately speak to the work which still needs to be done to increase the visibility and acceptance of the ace-spec community that the split attraction model does not occur to more people when they first hear the term “bi lesbian”, but
			<a href="https://www.them.us/story/bojack-horseman-asexuality" target="_blank">progress is slowly being made</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, this is not the end of the story. While the split attraction model is a compelling explanation of bi lesbianism, it does not encapsulate the described experience of all who use the label. Things can get a whole lot messier.
		</p>
		<h3 id="AlternateMeanings">Alternate Meanings</h3>
		<p>
			Generally speaking, without employing the split attraction model, the “bisexual lesbian” label does require a more expansive interpretation of “lesbian”, “bisexual”, or both. Most commonly, I’ve seen people retain the lesbian label not as a literal definition of their sexuality, but as a signifier of their connection to a community or set of political priorities. Lesbian, after all, is first and foremost a political term, a tool of activism and organization rather than a taxonomic tool. As mentioned previously, the exclusion of women who are attracted to men from the label is a relatively new phenomenon; there are many people alive today who adopted it under its original meaning.

			It is also not uncommon for transgender men who identified as lesbians earlier in life to retain the label through transition. This is sometimes for very similar reasons for why bisexual women also identify as lesbian, but there’s additional complexity here. Gender can be a slippery, fluid thing; it can also be chaotic. This is particularly apparent with the word
			<a href="https://www.them.us/story/inqueery-butch" target="_blank">butch</a>.
		</p>
		<div class="centertext-container">
			<blockquote class="card">
				"I know what butch is. Butches are not beginner FTMs [female-to-male transgender people], except that sometimes they are, but it's not a continuum except when it is. Butch is not a trans identity unless the butch in question says it is, in which case it is, unless the t****y in question says it isn't, in which case it's not. There is no such thing as butch flight, no matter what the femmes or elders say, unless saying that invalidates the opinions of femmes in a sexist fashion or the opinions of elders in an ageist fashion. Or if they're right. But they are not, because butch and transgender are not the same thing with different names, except that butch is not a trans identity, unless it is; see above."

			</blockquote>
		</div>
		<p>
			Butch sits pointedly at the intersection of sexuality and gender and is used by people with many kinds of disparate identities. Its usage frequently challenges what it means to be a woman, a man, or a lesbian. Many people who call themselves butch lesbians are also men, thereby testing the limits of the word lesbian from the opposite side of bi lesbians. Their culture is rich, their documented history long, and their importance to queer liberation undeniable – their interpretations of gender and lesbianism cannot and must not be torn out of the community for the sake of lexical tidiness. As inconvenient as it may be politically, nothing about being queer is tidy.
		</p>
		<p>
			The complexity does not end with personal identity labels – it can extend even to anatomical descriptors. Those in the explicitly genderfluid Leatherdyke community of the 90s, like many transgender people both contemporary and historic, engaged in the practice of [cw: explicit language in link]
			“<a href="https://www.bostonreview.net/articles/how-do-gender-transitions-happen/#:~:text=Leatherdyke%20genderplay%20enables,not%20understand%20it." target="_blank">recoding</a>” their bodies and their sexed aspects to those of their cross-sex counterparts. In transgender communities, this is frequently employed as a strategy to decrease discomfort during sexual activities; for some, it is the only way they can be sexually active.
		</p>
		<p>
			It doesn’t stop there. Some people outright refer to themselves as simultaneously (or alternatingly) a woman and a man, a gay man and a lesbian, a transgender woman and
			<a href="https://www.uwmedicine.org/practitioner-resource/lgbtq/lgbtq-inclusion-glossary#:~:text=Assigned%20female%20at%20birth/Assigned%20male%20at%20birth" target="_blank">AFAB</a>. What is being done here is largely outside of the purview of community building or taxonomy; it more resembles an abstract artform of metaphorically hinting at an emotional truth which escapes words. It is a use of labels which many object to both on the same grounds as are seen for the “bi lesbian” label, but also from a practical concern for community optics and the advancement of political goals.

			Semiotics is the study of signs, the means by which Humans convey meaning and understand the world. The linguist Ferdinand de Saussure defined signs as having two parts, the signified and the signifier. Nothing can be a sign outside of interpretation by a Human mind which imposes this relationship.
		</p>
		<p>
			A signifier is anything which calls forth a separate concept, its signified. According to Saussure, a signifier, like its signified, is psychological. Signifiers may therefore be created by sensory impressions of things in the world, but they do not have to be. For example, the concept of the word “apple” (or its sound pattern) is a signifier, not the physical glyphs which exist in the world. There are, of course, many things in the world which have tight associations with signifiers when exposed to our senses. They can be glyphs or sequences of glyphs which appear as contrasted pixels on a computer monitor, sound patterns either uttered or synthesized, a pattern of bumps embossed onto paper, a cloud of airborne molecules emitted from garlic and onion heated in oil, a concentration of particular flavonoids in a vegetable, or a hand gesture in which only the thumb protrudes from a fist. To some, these physical entities are themselves signifiers, but Saussure didn’t see it this way.

				<footer> Hornetbob by Aluomorg#2085 on Discord</footer>
			</div>
			A fun example of a sign is the Discord emoji Hornetbob. Created for a Hollow Knight fan server, I have adopted Hornetbob as one of my primary reaction emojis in interactions with my friends. In my use of it, it has come to mean something akin to nodding along to what someone else has said, but with a bit more excitement, or perhaps chuckling slightly. That surprisingly hard to describe reaction is the signified, and the impression of Hornetbob is the signifier.
		</p>
		<p>
			My workplace does not use Discord for a messaging service, so there I do not have access to this particular gif. When I wish to convey the same sentiment to my friends while at work, I will type “:hornetbob:” and send it as a message. The signified here is the exact same, and though the medium by which I communicated the signifier, the impression of the gif, is different, it is <em>also the same</em>. Both at work and on Discord, I am using the exact same sign to communicate with my friends.
		</p>
		<h3 id="ContextAndValue">Context and Value</h3>
		<p>
			Additionally, Saussure stresses that signs must be understood in the context of the system of signs in which they exist. He posited that systems of signs are differential, that each sign was given meaning specifically by its contrast to other signs, which he called its “value”.
		</p>

				"Language creates and separates 'knower' and 'known', 'subject' and 'object'. 'We know what a thing is by cutting it off from other things' (Ong, 1977). We categorize even that which is not clearly discrete or bounded: as in the case of a 'hill' or a 'corner'. Indeed, things do not ex-ist (or stand out) until we call them into being: we create rather than discover the worlds we know through the categories we draw from language. In this sense we live in the word, and all words are 'abstractions': there can be no direct correspondence between the word and the world. 'The world' only exists in language"

		<p>
			In this way we can see how signs, and linguistics in particular, serves to construct the way in which we view the world. Without a word to denote something as distinct from other things, it (and its differentiating factors) more easily go below notice. A wonderful example of this is given by Philosophy Tube in the hypothetical signs of
			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koud7hgGyQ8&t=268s" target="_blank">“big” and “mini”</a> used to denote groups of people who are above five feet tall and those below, respectively. Outside of this hypothetical we have no words for these concepts, so while we might notice that people are taller or shorter than each other, we do not feel the need to assign people into these groups based on their height.
		</p>
		<p>
			Returning to the Hornetbob example, though the gif exists for others to use, none of them have the context of its use among my friend group. When they use the gif, they are sending an entirely different sign. Even further, those who have no knowledge of Hollow Knight or Discord may not have anything to associate with the gif it all, it fails to be a sign for them entirely.

			We may use this semiotic framework to discern that those who conjoin contradictory labels are doing a few distinct things.
		</p>
		<p>
			First, they are creating a novel symbol from what any of the labels individually could represent. Though what a combination of labels signifies in general may not be altogether clear to someone who has not before seen them in conjunction, they are also provided with an example: their subject. Esoteric though it may begin, with wide enough adoption it may become clear what the conjunction of these labels means in culture.
		</p>
		<p>
			Secondly, they are attacking the dominant framework which asserts that the labels are mutually exclusive. This is what Tumblr user
			<a href="https://www.tumblr.com/queerbatting/711267967547129856/people-need-to-realize-that-dissolving-the-lines" target="_blank">queerbatting</a> means when they say that “male isn’t the opposite of female.” And they’re right, very little about the physical world is discrete; differentiation is something humans do to their surroundings when they create symbols.
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally, they are challenging the necessity of the categorizations they employ. Just as the world can exist without the concepts of “big” and “mini”, could not the world also exist without the labels of “gay” and “straight”? After all, the word “homosexual”
			<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/homosexual#Etymology" target="_blank">did not exist</a> until 1868. In a world where queer liberation is entirely realized, the utility of differentiating people by their attraction is greatly diminished.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, in the current world, words and labels do have utility – they can still serve the interest in advancing human rights. For an example of the power of words, let’s look briefly at the word “disabled”.
		</p>
		<h3 id="TheSocialModelOfDisability">The Social Model of Disability</h3>
		<p>
			Historically, disability has been understood primarily through the lens of medicine and healthcare. This view identifies disability as deficiencies in a person’s ability when compared to others. So, for example, if a person cannot ambulate without a wheelchair, that is seen inherently as a disability.
		</p>
		<p>
			Some of these deficiencies can be corrected through medicine and technology, but often they cannot. In these cases, the words we have do not directly afford us a means of addressing the issues disabled people face in everyday life. If they cannot access the second floor of a building, it is seen as because they cannot climb stairs, a problem without an actionable solution.
		</p>
		<p>
			By contrast, the Social Model of disability changes the definition of the word “disability” to refer specifically to the deficiency of access a person experiences to the interactions of daily life. In this framing, the deficiency of a person’s ability to perform actions is called an “impairment”. Using this model, when a person does not have the ability to access the second floor of a building, this disability is imposed on them by the building’s lack of an elevator.

			Here we can see that language itself and our use of it can be a powerful tool in changing how people think about the issues they face and how they might be addressed.
		</p>
		<h3 id="TheRoyalShe">The Royal She</h3>
		<p>
			Another use for language can be to call out pertinent social dynamics at play in issues affecting groups of people. To illustrate this, we can look at two very different books which employ the practice of explicitly gendering groups of people who are not, in fact, uniform in gender. Doing so in each case calls out the gendered dynamics of the problems described, which can afford means for organization and provide links to related issues which might need to be addressed together to be most effective.

				"People of all genders sell sex: transgender and cisgender men, non-binary people, and those with indigenous or non-western genders such as hijra, fa'afafine, and two-spirit people. It is important to acknowledge this because peoples' gender shapes their route into sex work, their experiences while selling sex, and their lives beyond. Equally, however, it is important not to lose sight of the fact that the sex industry is <em>gendered</em>: the majority of those who sell sex are women, and the vast majority of those who pay for sex are men. In this book, we often refer to sex workers as 'she', and to clients as 'he'. We are not under the mistaken impression that this is literally true in every single instance, but nor is it an error, or something we have neglected to consider. It is a deliberate choice because in our view it reflects the gendered reality of the sex trade, as well as our own feminist politics and priorities."

				"Men of all ages and in all parts of the world are more violent than women. For this reason, the language in this book is mostly gender-specific to men. When it comes to violence, women can proudly relinquish recognition in the language, because here at least, politically correct would be statistically incorrect."

			It is for this reason why it is still useful to frame abortion as a womens’ rights issue; the opposition to female reproductive health resources is extremely gendered in its nature, and we would be doing ourselves a political disservice by refusing to acknowledge that. It is equally important, though, that we do not exclude non-women from the fight for reproductive rights. Reproductive care is for everyone.

			I call out these examples to lend credibility to the concerns people raise about the political implications of deconstructing labels used for queer liberation. I do, however, agree with the eventual goal of dismantling many of the labels we use for these political purposes when they are no longer needed, we just need to be careful about how we go about that.
		</p>
		<p>
			Getting to a point where gender in particular can be completely deconstructed seems implausible to me, unfortunately. I am a firm believer in Julia Serano’s concept of
			<a href="https://www.juliaserano.com/terminology.html#:~:text=its%20homonormativity.-,Subconscious%20Sex,-%3A%20a%20term%20I" target="_blank">subconscious sex</a>, or an innate sense people have about what their physical sex should be. After dismantling the massive amount of gender baggage ubiquitous throughout society, if subconscious sex remains valid as a concept then people will still medically transition. They may be able to do so without the language of gender, but without that language is seems very difficult indeed to meaningfully communicate the necessary ideas.
		</p>
		<h2 id="Viscera">Viscera</h2>
		<p>
			As a last point here, I want to talk about my own visceral feelings about all of this. Deconstructing labels is an extraordinarily charged thing, and I won’t pretend I don’t have skin in the game. When people, in good faith, object to the term “bi lesbian” or to the seemingly whimsical use of one of the labels they had to struggle for years to be at peace with, <em>I know how they feel</em>. It’s tough.

		<p>
			To illustrate what I mean, this is a Tumblr post that put a large stone right into the pit of my stomach.

			This post works to dismantle the barrier between transgender women and feminine men, a barrier which I and most transgender people have a vested personal and political interest in maintaining. I don’t think that strawberry-crocodile is necessarily wrong to question the necessity of this gender categorization, but I do think that she is wrong to do it at this particular moment, and in this particular form.
		</p>
		<p>
			It’s always a balancing act, trying to meet the ideals of the world we want to build and the practical requirements for building that world.
