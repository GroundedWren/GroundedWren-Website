					<h3>So, what's this then?</h3>
					<p>
						These are the macro-enabled Excel workbooks I made to play D&D with my friends.
						They're kind of a lot - I've spent at least a few hundred hours on this project.<br />
						I tried to make them flexible enough to be able to accomodate at least the main classes in D&D 5e (I've used them for a number of characters). Feel free to try to use them - your mileage may vary, though.
					</p>
					<h3>Wait, Excel?</h3>
					<p>
						Yeah. If you didn't know, Excel, along with a lot of other MS Office products, supports scripting using "<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/library-reference/concepts/getting-started-with-vba-in-office" target="_blank">VBA</a>", or Visual Basic for Applications.<br />
						It's seriously old-school. Like, just look at the IDE:
					</p>
					<div class="card image-frame">
						<img src="../img/Misc/VBA.png"
							 alt="A screenshot of the VB IDE with some D&D workbook code open. It looks really old." />
					</div>
					<p>
						People have used VBA to do terrible, awful things over the years, and Microsoft <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/security/internet-macros-blocked" target="_blank">seems to really regret its existence.</a>
					</p>
					<h3>...and this is how you decided to program a character sheet?</h3>
					<p>
						Yeah, I suppose I have some explaining to do.
					</p>
					<p>
						So, when my first character, Eryn, died, I decided to play a Wizard. Eryn was a Ranger, which I had specifically chosen for its accessibility since I was a new player.<br />
						As you can imagine, playing a Wizard was a little bit of a difficulty spike. I struggled in particular with keeping track of all my spells and what they did, so I eventually made a spreadsheet for them to augment my pdf character sheet. It looked something like this:
					</p>
					<div class="card image-frame">
						<img src="../img/Misc/OldSpellSheet.png"
							 alt="An excel sheet with various tables describing spells. There is also an image of a tiefling and a screenshot of the movie '50 Shades of Grey'" />
						<footer>The 50 Shades thing is because Vera kept her spell book in the sleeve of a smutty romance novel</footer>
					</div>
					<p>
						This worked for quite some time.<br />
						Eventually, though, I had to learn how to program in Visual Basic for my job (don't ask). Simultaneously, I acquired some more managerial, spreadsheet-oriented tasks. Naturally, I ended up combining these things to make some pretty excessive spreadsheets.
					</p>
					<p>
						I felt like I had gained some dark, tabboo power. So, of course I used that power for D&D.
					</p>
					<p>
						It started small at first - just some shortcuts to expend spell slots and determine what was available to cast. Then I got started making user forms, and it was all downhill from there.<br />
						I got a lot of satisfaction showing my group what was new in my spreadsheet each week and seeing the horror on their faces. I was making Excel do things for which it was never intended, things for which should not be used. It was awesome.
					</p>
					<p>
						Recently though I've lost steam. The project has about hit critical mass - you can only write spaghetti for so long. I still use my workbook, but I don't actively add anything anymore.
					</p>
					<h2>You monster. How do I use this?</h2>
					<p>
						Quite frankly, I don't have the spoons to make a tutorial. However, there is some documentation inside the workbooks themselves, so hopefully that's useful.<br />
						I've also provided the filled-out workbook I have for my character Vera - it's the third link. This snapshot was captured on 1/29/23.
					</p>
					<p>
						In short, though, you'll mostly just want the workbook in the first link. It can hold all of your character sheet info. The workbook in the second link is full of monster statblocks and works with the "Monsters" sheet in the character sheet workbook. I use it for when I summon things.
