			A burst of fire ripped through the scraggly and knotted branches of the blight; the high-pitched squeal of evaporating moisture within the wood sounded like a cry of pain as the tangled mess all but vaporized in the blast. The flash revealed the color of the tomb’s walls to Orianna’s peering eyes: a splash of green and brown which only slowly faded from the moist and crumbling stone bricks. Shadows briefly stretched across her face, highlighting her slightly surprised look to the crouched Tiefling across the hall.
		</p>
		<p>
			“Very good, Orianna,” she said, the red of her face melting back to gray. Her long black hair was also becoming darker, somehow. “Your aim is improving. But tell me, what did you see?”
		</p>
		<p>
			Orianna blinked. “The blight burned away, and I could see that the next room ends in a corner to the right. Maybe 10, 20 meters?”
		</p>
		<p>
			The Tiefling steadily held her gaze and told her to lead down the next passage. Orianna’s vision was still adjusting, but was there a slight smile on her mentor’s lips? It was impossible to tell, so she decided to take it as a sign she was doing well. Vera hadn’t let her lead yet at any point in their careful five hour decent into this dank tomb.
		</p>
		<p>
			The young Elf got to her feet and began slowly creeping forward. Feeling her mentor’s gaze, she made sure to keep her stance low with her arms out, and to use the deliberate yet delicate stepping pattern in which she had been meticulously instructed. She was so focused on maintaining perfect form that she nearly jumped straight up as her right boot met the stone tiled ground, <i>then kept going</i>. A horrible <i>clack</i> from behind her echoed off the walls and made her stomach drop.
		</p>
		<p>
			Orianna spun around, briefly felt the pressure of a hand on her shoulder, then stumbled to the ground as a pulse of atmospheric pressure made her ears pop. As she looked up, it took her several seconds to process what she was seeing. Vera was standing three or four meters down the passage from her, <i>where she had just been standing</i>, and was surrounded by a translucent bubble of force which seemed to cast moonlight into this dark place. The grinding of ancient gears could be heard faintly behind the walls as several darts buzzed across the room directly at the infernal woman’s softly illuminated form. The bubble rippled gently as the darts ricocheted off to clatter and break against the walls. Suddenly, it was over – the grinding ceased, and all was again still. After a tense pause which seemed to last minutes, the Tiefling chuckled softly. “You still have much to learn.”
		</p>
		<hr />
		<p>
			“May I see it?” asked Orianna for perhaps the fifth time. “I’ll be really careful, I promise!” Vera was not in the mood for this at all – they had been on the road for three days, and that was just the return trip. Her skin was scraped and bruised from cutting through the undergrowth to get out of the dense forest, her hair was dusty and full of knots, and she couldn’t remember the last time she’d had a proper bath. Her apprentice had just entered adulthood at just a few years over one hundred, but sometimes, she thought, it wasn’t easy to tell.
		</p>
		<p>
			“Fine. Two minutes. Do not drop this,” said Vera in the calmest voice she could muster through her annoyance as she quickly produced the large, shining purple diamond from her satchel. Though the sun was obscured by clouds and trees, the ambient light was enough to make this magnificent gem seem to glow from within. Orianna’s receiving hands held it firmly and steadily as the curious young wizard was transfixed.
		</p>
		<p>
			“Gods – how can you say you’re disappointed by this, Vera? It’s beautiful.”
		</p>
		<p>
			“Beautiful? Perhaps, but purple diamonds are not valued at nearly the same level as their clear counterparts. We won’t get a fraction of what it would be worth if it were clear.”
		</p>
		<p>
			“What? How can clear diamonds be worth more; do merchants have eyes?” asked Orianna, almost indignantly.
		</p>
		<p>
			“It’s not the merchants,” sighed Vera, “It’s the bloody nobles. ‘Distinguished taste’ has determined that they bear too much resemblance to amethyst. The elite want their diamonds to be absolutely unequivocal.”
		</p>
		<p>
			“This is no amethyst,” protested Orianna. “Besides, what do nobles’ opinions have to do with the weave? Won’t this still work?” Orianna placed the diamond back into Vera’s extended hand, which briefly dipped from the weight.
		</p>
		<p>
			“It’s less about the diamond itself, my young learner, than it is about the value it holds. The weave is tied to more than the material – it has a real connection to us all. One day you will understand,” she said with a certain finality. The duo walked in silence along the dirt path through the trees which, like most paths, eventually led to Waterdeep.
		</p>
		<hr />
		<p>
			“Grab my hand, Orianna,” commanded Vera with only a hint of panic in her voice.
		</p>
		<p>
			The pair of adventurers had waited for hours in the shipping yard at the meeting point but were not graced with the presence of their elite patron: Lord Percival Bromley the second. It was most unlike him to not be impeccably punctual. In fact, it was cause for alarm.
		</p>
		<p>
			It was no secret where Lord Bromley lived; his mansion was one of the most impressive in its highly opulent district of Waterdeep. They could not just walk up to it though; they had arranged to meet at the docks for a reason. That part of town tends to have scrutinizing eyes about – a Lord hosting a scraggly wizard duo is not something which would go unnoticed. Unfortunately, they now had no choice.
		</p>
		<p>
			As they approached that part of town, Vera had wordlessly turned them both invisible much to Orianna’s surprise. She was aware of this magic, but actually experiencing it – to look down and not see her own body – was an exhilarating experience.
		</p>
		<p>
			There was nothing obviously amiss about Lord Bromley’s mansion. Its elegant, though currently lightless towers accented the view distinctly from a mile away. There was no sign of any activity within, which was slightly unusual, as servants normally were scurrying about to do unseen yet important work. The pair did one circle around the walls beneath the notice of the guards on patrol before Vera extended her hand to Orianna, and the wizards materialized inside to a horrible sight.
		</p>
		<p>
			Blood was everywhere. It was pooled on the expensive rugs, splattered across the fine paintings - it was even dripping from the coffered ceiling. The discriminating decor of the drawing room made the red liquid seem almost deliberately placed in artistic contrast. The horror of the bodies littering the floor was indeed almost elevated by the calm, aesthetic furniture. Amid the crumpled forms of the servants lay the body of Lord Percival Bromley, dressed in his finest and bled out from the neck.
		</p>
		<p>
			Orianna gulped. “Lady Moonbow, Gods… Percy…” she stammered, each word bringing her closer to tears. While Orianna was immobilized, her fingers digging into the binding of her spell book, Vera sprung immediately over to Lord Percival and knelt beside him. Her face showed only a bit of panic behind her mask of cool professionalism as she removed the diamond from her bag with her left hand while her right hand deftly flipped through her spell book.
		</p>
		<p>
			“It’s only been a couple days,” she said coolly.  “I need your help, Orianna. Hold this.” Vera extended the diamond toward her. After a brief pause, the student wrested control of her body back from the shock and rushed over to kneel with her mentor.
		</p>
		<p>
			After Vera had been incanting magic Orianna did not understand in Abyssal for nearly an hour, the weight of the diamond slowly began to lift. This was a great relief for the Elf’s exhausted arms, but also a surprise. She had been lost in thought about Lord Bromley and their prior interactions – she had barely spoke to him, but he always seemed so kind. She knew what Vera was attempting now, but she simply couldn’t help but begin to grieve anyway. All at once, Vera stood and shouted the last lines of the spell in a tone which was not just authoritative, but angry. The diamond completely dematerialized out of Orianna’s trembling hands and was absorbed into Lord Bromley’s form, which momentarily glowed purple. Vera staggered back sapped at the conclusion of her spell, and Orianna nearly wept as Percy took a shaky breath….
