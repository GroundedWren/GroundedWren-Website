			<p>
				Years have passed and circumstances have changed.
				Though Orianna's skills have grown, she is still no match for the forces which have been set in motion.

			The leather straps of the weathered brown bag ground heavily against Orianna’s muscled shoulders as its contents clacked with every step. If anyone figured out what she was carrying, if anyone had heard of their mission, there would be no escape from this busy street without a fight. Vera, disguised as an aged Human of moderately high birth and means, led the way through the tight streets of the Protector’s Enclave towards the great scar of rubble and desolation etched into the city’s cheek, where the great Chasm once gaped.
		</p>
		<p>
			Standing above the broken stones and the dusty paths swept between them was a great tavern, the only deliberately placed structure for several hundred feet in any direction. The great wound was dotted with such building as these, like new trees pushing through the ashen ground of a great fire. The sight of this youthful tavern with its clean-cut edges rising defiantly toward the darkening sky lifted the wander-weary Elf’s heart – there is hope here. It was enough to distract her from the grim ordeals she had been through the prior years, and from their eventual goal which constantly sat uneasily in the pit of her stomach. In this moment, Orianna smiled.
		</p>
		<p>
			It was quiet inside, aside from the crackling of the torches on the walls, aside from the soft murmur of the dozen patrons and their rude mastication, aside from the soft clink of glassware as the Half-Orc busboy cleared tables, and aside from the deafening pressure of the stares these outsiders were getting from the well-dressed trio of Humans at the corner table. Vera approached a brass colored Dragonborn leaning against one of the building’s great oak pillars as his lute dangled lightly from his hands. She got rather close, whispered something into his ear, and passed him a few gold pieces. Without lingering, she resumed her march toward the corner table. Orianna followed quietly, shooting a low smile at the Dragonborn as he began to strum and clear his throat.
		</p>
		<p>
			Their conversation was carried out in hushed tones, spoken quickly. Orianna sat silently behind Vera, observing as her mentor spoke with intensity of their treasure, of its dark purpose, and of their patron: Lord Bromley. Orianna let her mind wander to him, to how a deep sorrow had fallen over her when they found him dead, and to how elated she was at his resurrection. How foreign those naïve feelings were to her now – they should have let him rot. She was jolted back to the tavern as Vera tapped her shoulder, gesturing at their company. Orianna discretely slipped the heavy bag from her shoulders and slid it under the table to them.
		</p>

		<p>
			A deep shadow from Mount Waterdeep fell upon the city, extinguishing the natural light far earlier than the sun would actually set. This sort of darkness upon Waterdeep always brought trouble, masking hushed plots and sinister deeds. The town could feel it too – windows everywhere were latched, door locks were double checked, and those who did move about the streets did so with a hushed urgency. The towers of Lord Bromley’s manor radiated a low glow which was hungrily devoured by the blackness of the sky, barely reaching the eyes of the wizard duo as they approached invisibly. They were not alone.
		</p>
		<p>
			Ushered inside, the mansion was as devoid of life as it had been the day Percy was slain. Empty, dusty rooms. Still, heavy air. The lamplight signaled presence, but the house itself felt utterly dead. Orianna did not approach the remaining servant who had let them inside. He was… wrong, somehow. He moved with the stiffness of an old man, though his face suggested remnants of youth in its color. The air in here was cold, and the servant seemed an extension of this fact. No words were spoken.
		</p>
		<p>
			At the base of one of the towers, the servant stopped before a great wooden door. There was a low humming coming from the other side, a hum which might have come from a bounty hunter loading bodies onto a cart, or from a gravedigger scooping the last bit of frigid ground out for the damned. Orianna audibly gulped, twisting the tight silver ring around her finger. Vera shot her a look, and the Elf’s pale hand dropped back to her side, resting against her heavy brown leather bag. With a deep sigh, the Tiefling pushed the creaking door open.
		</p>
		<hr />
		<p>
			Lord Percival Bromley was expecting them, but he did not stand from his dark wooden desk. Yellowed papers lay scattered about the room, coupled with old, wilting books. Orianna noted a myriad of languages when glancing over them, including many that she did not recognize. A low fire grumbled in the elegant frame behind the Lord, the smoke rising through the long brick flue and through the high ceiling, up into the slender tower. A shallow pit, obviously a recent modification, was dug into the floor on the right side of the room. At this angle Orianna could not see into it, but it was emanating a faint red glow ominously into the air.
		</p>
		<p>
			After a moment of silence, Vera opened her mouth to speak. “Lord Bromley, we…” she was cut off as Percival raised his hand.  A hand which, to Orianna, seemed to belong to a much older man than the rest of his body would suggest.
		</p>
		<p>
			“Vera. Orianna. Good of you to come. Please, have a seat before we discuss your travels.” He gestured at two expensive-looking chairs placed before his desk, seemingly just for this meeting. “You must be very tired.”
		</p>
		<p>
			Vera hesitated just a moment, then approached and took her seat. Orianna followed. At this distance, Percy looked very strange in a way not dissimilar to the servant waiting just outside. His youthful pallor seemed a bit too enthusiastic and did not suit him. Orianna pondered the slight wrinkles in his face as she sat down.
		</p>
		<p>
			“So, do you have them?” Percy asked.
		</p>
		<p>
			“Yes,” said Vera confidently. “There were some complications, but-”
		</p>
		<p>
			“All of them? You know my research requires all six together, I trust,” He asked with a note of condescension.
		</p>
		<p>
			“Of course, Lord Bromley. Orianna, the diamonds,” the Tiefling commanded. Orianna shifted the bag onto her lap and opened the flap. Six deeply purple diamonds stared back at her as she reached in and pulled one out, displaying it to their Patron.
		</p>
		<p>
			“Excellent. Hand them over, young one,” he said with a feigned kindness. Orianna looked toward Vera, who subtly nodded. She placed the diamond back into the bag and passed it across the desk. “Thank you.” He paused. “I also see that you’ve brought the other thing I need,” he said with a slight smile. Vera’s red face paled slightly, and for several beats the room was incredibly still.
		</p>
		<hr />
		<p>
			“Now!” Vera yelled, rising abruptly from her chair. Five hooded figures behind her suddenly shifted into opaqueness, swords raised. Orianna jumped back from the desk, her chair clattering to the wooden floor, and drew her wand.
		</p>
		<p>
			Percy did not start; his smile simply grew across his face. “Fools,” he growled in an otherworldly voice, and stood from his chair.
		</p>
		<p>
			Vera yelled an incantation, and a bolt of energy leapt from her wand, crashed straight through Percy, and exploded the bricks of the fireplace behind him. As the electricity stretched across his form, a simple gesture from his hand seemed to reduce the effect. His shadowed figure loomed large as the flash died. He drew a deep breath, and a shattering word boomed across the room on the heels of the thunder.
		</p>
		<p>
			Vera staggered back as the hooded figures charged Lord Bromley, her wand slipping from her hand. Her face turned toward her apprentice whose breath shook as she saw streaks of blood dripping from her reddened eyes, then from her ears. She opened her mouth only to retch more of the horribly bright blood onto the ground. Their eye contact held for just a moment before the Tiefling collapsed to the cold floor.
		</p>
		<hr />
		<p>
			It was over in seconds. The five hooded figures lay broken before Lord Bromley, whose youthful pallor had drained entirely from his face. His figure was now of a tall and withered old man; his unnaturally gray and drooping flesh was painted red by the deaths of the five. He stood still, triumphantly.
		</p>
		<p>
			Orianna’s scream had died in her throat as her mentor fell to the floor – she was now on her knees before her with hot tears streaming down her face. She looked up at Percival, striding calmly toward her.
		</p>
		<p>
			“Do you really think your treachery would go unnoticed?” he sneered, wiping the blood from his face. Suddenly he was upon her; he thrust out his hand and clenched his cold, bony fingers closed around her throat. She choked for only a moment before he released her, but Orianna quickly realized with horror that her every joint was locked in place as her nerves screamed electric. Her grief gave way to the smashing beat of adrenaline, but her body refused to respond as fingers twitched helplessly by her side.
		</p>
		<p>
			“I am always watching, young one. You cannot even begin to comprehend the kinds of power I have achieved, and they are nothing in the face of what’s to come!” His eyes grew distant for a moment, then refocused on the young Elf, and he smiled with his horrible yellow teeth. “You are going to receive a great honor, my feeble friend: you will be the first to witness the might of the Ascended Lord!”
		</p>
		<p>
			Lord Bromley strode over to the pit at the side of the room, leaving the brown bag of purple gems behind on his desk. From his own bag he produced the six <i>real</i> diamonds, much to Orianna’s shock. How had he gotten them?
		</p>
		<p>
			Percy carefully placed the diamonds around the pit, then drug the poor corpses of the five into it, leaving great swaths of blood drawn on the floor. When all was assembled, Percival began speaking in a horrible tongue Orianna did not recognize. Each word stung as a caustic acid smoking in her ears; were she not immobilized she would have collapsed from the pain.
		</p>
		<p>
			As the incantations continued, the lights in the room gradually faded to nothing. All was the deep red glow from the pit, casting shadows up across the old man’s face. With a triumphant finish, he stepped into the shallow crater and slammed his hand upon an object Orianna could not see. An explosion of noise shook the books from their shelves, and the red glow became a great flash. Blinded, Orianna could only hear Percy’s horrible screams of pain mixed with insane laughter.
		</p>
		<hr />
		<p>
			Once vision had returned to her eyes, Lord Bromley was gone. There was now only the ragged figure of the Ascended Lord rising from the pit, his tattered robes draped over emaciated, dead flesh. “Ah! AAAHHHH!” He let out a terrible scream which seemed to carry two voices together – one a deep growl and one a shrill screech. His roaring eventually gave way to sinister laughter as he began shambling toward Orianna’s still petrified form.
		</p>
		<p>
			Orianna’s wand hand was slowly regaining feeling – she could feel the tips of her fingers! Desperately, she twitched her stiff digits, moving the wand slightly up and down. With great effort, her lips eked out a small whisper as the Lich passed his desk. Just behind him, the the six fake diamonds exploded in percussive, incendiary unison.
		</p>
		<p>
			The fireplace, which once housed a dying flame, was now an inferno. The chimney bricks were scattered about the room with the embers, igniting the highly flammable old books and pages. The Lich was not to be seen amongst the smoke, but his scream seemed to come from everywhere. Jolted out of his vice, Orianna crawled desperately toward Vera and grabbed her arm. Flicking her finger across the ring on her broken hand, the duo vanished from the burning mansion with a soft pop.
