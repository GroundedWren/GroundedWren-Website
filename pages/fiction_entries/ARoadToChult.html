        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            Woe to those who seek to conquer Death herself.<br />
            <br />
            A young wizard apprentice is destined to journey alone to Chult, not for any wealth or glory, but in a desperate bid to undo her own mistakes. No training can prepare her for the painful and bloody path she must walk before her real adventure can even begin.
        </p>
        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>This is a player character backstory to a Tomb of Annihilation campaign I'm in.</p>
        <p>It exists in a different universe from my Adventures of The Risen series, though some characters carry over.</p>
        <p>Content warning: blood and death.</p>
