			<i>Recruit Laelius - We are pleased to inform you that your application for service aboard the PFS Brusco has been accepted!</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			Sindri read the sentence four or five times on his omni-tool, lingering on each word - they soothed his nerves as the shuttlecraft violently blasted out of the atmosphere. The shaking made him nauseous to read, but Sindri pressed on.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>You will serve as a security officer under the direct command of Dr. Vadia Alerius, the Biology team lead. Follow the directions in the attached information sheet to prepare for your departure tomorrow, 05.12.2176. You will be fully briefed aboard.</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			Sindri closed his omni-tool. That last sentence had inflicted misery on him for the last 16 hours; it was the biggest cliffhanger Sindri had ever known in his 17 short years. Every detail of his life for the foreseeable future was being held tantalizingly just out of his grasp. His career was so close now, and he was literally rocketing towards it with incredible speed.
		</p>
		<p>
			The shuttlecraft’s tremors subsided as it slipped the atmosphere. There were four other Turian recruits also on board, all strapped-in tightly in a row with Sindri. Though Sindri’s class had aged into service together, this group had been drawn from all over the planet – they did not know each other. The departure had been so rapid and so loud that they had not had the opportunity to greet one another, but Sindri had gotten to look them over. The young male to his right was looking pretty green, and not just because of his green facial tattoos. A look between nervous and nauseous had not left the poor guy’s face since takeoff - he was clearly new to flying. The slightly older female to his left was cool as a cucumber, a boredom sat upon her stronger than the G-forces they had just experienced. The remaining two were clearly brothers, identical in looks and mannerisms. Though none of them had spoken, these two were somehow quieter and more slight; a subtle nervousness reflected identically from the brown carapace of their faces. They hadn’t looked away from the window the entire trip - and something now caught their eyes.
		</p>
		<p>
			Sindri traced their gaze until he saw it - a sleek silver freighter hovering majestically above the curved green surface of Palaven; it was the Brusco, it had to be. “Wow,” the nauseous recruit next to him whispered under his breath.
		</p>
		<p>
			“I think that’s our ride,” said Sindri, his mandibles spreading in a smile. The recruit Turned to look at him, excitement glinting in his eyes.
		</p>
		<p>
			“What a beauty!” He exclaimed with a heavy accent clearly from the southern continent. Sindri thought it sounded quite refined, giving him an air of sophistication. It certainly matched his snazzy pressed clothes, which seemed all the posher next to Sindri’s drab casualwear. “I’m Titus - pleasure to meet you,” he said, extending his arm through the restraints.
		</p>
		<p>
			“Sindri,” he chirped back, taking Titus’ hand as best he could at their awkward angle. “Good to meet you too!” Titus nodded, then looked back at the ship growing ever larger in the shuttle window.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Brusco had an angular design common to the Turian fleet, with downward protruding wings suited for atmospheric flight. Sindri didn’t know why it hadn’t landed to pick them up, but he was sure the captain had a good reason. The shuttle was slowly coming around the frigate to the cargo bay in back, allowing the starry-eyed recruits ample chance to study their new ship. As a science vessel, it was less heavily armored than typical Frigates, allowing for additional sensors and various apparatus to be mounted on the hull. It all made the ship look very sophisticated - and probably quite expensive. Squinting, Sindri could just make out some figures standing on the bridge. He couldn’t quite tell at this distance, but he thought they were watching the shuttle’s approach.
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally, the cargo bay doors came into view. They opened slowly as the shuttle creeped into its final approach. A loud crash startled Sindri as the shuttle suddenly jolted, throwing the recruits against their harnesses. The female passenger’s air of boredom broke as she let out a surprised <i>skreeek</i>, a mild curse without meaning. “Sorry!” yelled the flustered pilot as he regained control of the craft, putting it down somewhat clumsily. Titus giggled a bit with his sub-vocals and gave Sindri a nudge. Someone was probably in trouble.
		</p>
		<p>
			The shuttle’s door lowered with a hiss as the recruits unbuckled from their harnesses. Three distinguished Turians in meticulously neat uniforms stood waiting behind the shuttle, and they did not look particularly amused. Titus and Sindri had to focus to bring their mandibles back into a serious expression as they descended the ramp and stood at attention with the others. A few seconds later the pilot, young and spunky with orange facial tattoos, came jogging out a bit flustered.
		</p>
		<p>
			“Recruits - welcome to the Brusco” said the middle Turian. He looked to be in his mid-fifties, a bit of wear on his facial plates and a natural authoritative air about him. His silver facial tattoos in their broad lines over his brows matched his stern disposition. “I am Captain Decilus Candus. This is my First Officer, Vivia Tannus,” he said gesturing to the tall woman on his left, “and this is Dr. Vadia Alerius,” he concluded, gesturing to his right. Vadia looked to be in her thirties and had a kind of energy about her, bordering on impatience. Sindri imagined her personality as he looked at her, trying to figure out the best manner to conduct himself while under her command. “You all have many questions I am sure - we will have a formal briefing at 1800 hours tonight in the observation lounge. I expect you all to be in full uniform. In the meantime, Commander Tannus and Dr. Alerius will give you the tour.” Candus paused for a second, shooting a look at the pilot who squirmed under his gaze. “We will discuss the landing mishap after the briefing. Recruits,” he saluted, and the new arrivals reflexively returned the naval salute they had all learned so well at boot camp before he walked away.
		</p>
		<p>
			“If you will follow me, our first stop will be engineering,” said Commander Tannus, guiding the recruits away from the damaged shuttle. Though younger than the captain, she had all his confidence as she strode confidently toward the shuttle bay’s forward bulkhead, her tall frame lending to a pace which the recruits scrambled to keep up with. No sooner had the group taken their first steps than Titus whispered into Sindri’s ear, “Decilus Candus? More like Delicious Candy.” It was all Sindri could do to stifle a laugh which would certainly have gotten him in trouble, but he knew at that moment that Titus would be a good friend.
