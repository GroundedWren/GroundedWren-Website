			appearanceDetails: "<p>Vera is a travel-weary short Tiefling woman. She carries herself confidently and with a degree of smugness. She is frequently smirking, but there is usually melancholy behind her eyes.</p>"
				+ "<ul>"
				+ "<li>Black, shoulder length wavy hair. Always worn down, often messy.</li>"
				+ "<li>Deep brown irises. Sclera are a brownish off-white.</li>"
				+ "<li>Upper lip is darker.</li>"
				+ "<li>Fingernails are claw-like and black.</li>"
				+ "<li>Horns are skin-color and begin just before her hair-line. They are <i>mostly</i> blunt.</li>"
				+ "<li>She always wears three rings on her left horn. They vary, but are usually cool colors. Notably, they have appeared as the colors of the bisexual and transgender flags.</li>"
				+ "<li>Built somewhat delicately, though in healthy proportion.</li>"
				+ "<li>Skin is a subtly pale red, which does not change hue on the palms of her hands or feet.</li>"
				+ "<li>Short for a tiefling.</li>"
				+ "<li>Thin, long devil tail which she often keeps tucked away.</li>"
				+ "<li>Standard humanoid feet with plantigrade legs.</li>"
				+ "</ul>",

			personality: "<p>Vera is good at heart and cares about people, but often doesn't quite know how to show it. Her exaggerated boisterousness and performative condescention are masks for a deeply sad and insecure soul.</p>"

				+ "<li>Often aloof or smug</li>"
				+ "<li>Frequently mischevious - loves pranks</li>"
				+ "<li>Extremely willful</li>"
				+ "</ul",

			backstory: "<p>Vera was born to two human parents in Bluecrest, who were highly surprised to have a Tiefling daughter. Though her father did his best to raise her, her mother abandoned them both. She accused Vera’s father of having an affair which resulted in a non-human child  (she wasn’t smart).</P>"
				+ "<p>As a Tiefling, Vera did not have many opportunities handed to her, and faced much hostility from most people. Vera used reading as an escape, finding particular interest in history and legend. She excelled in her studies and was well on her way to being accepted to the college.</P>"
				+ "<p>Upon her acceptance to the college, Vera at once did not like Orianna. Effortlessly gaining the attention of Professor Wayland was  something Vera longed to replicate, but could not. Vera harassed Orianna relentlessly, often demeaning her intellect and criticizing the quality of her constructs. On one occasion Orianna snapped, and Vera was forced to destroy one such construct - this was shortly before Orianna’s larger meltdown, to which Vera undeniably contributed.</P>"
				+ "<p>Cyrus, for all of his shortcomings, is one of the few people in Vera’s life who is not wary of her infernal heritage - he doesn’t seem to notice at all. This alone has earned Vera’s respect and loyalty.</P>"
				+ "<p>Vera is concerned by her father’s declining health, but lacks the courage to visit often.</P>",

				+ "<p>After several years, a Noble exerted his influence to legally sieze the profitable fields of Freya's home town. Unhappy with any settlement, Freya rallied the folk together in protest, and eventually the Noble was thwarted.</p>"
				+ "<p>Seeing her single-minded devotion to the righteous cause of destroying the undead, and her leadership in rallying her town in a noble cause, Lathander blessed her as a paladin.</p>"
				+ "<p>When she felt she was strong enough, Freya took a boat to Port Nyanzaru, finally returning to  her homeland....</p>",

				+ "<p>Sindri is a wine/lavender colored Turian male. This means he stands around 6 feet tall, has digitigrade legs, and a hard carapace which covers a good amount of his body. Sindri is physically healthy and has a lean build.</p>"
				+ "<p>Sindri's tattoos are unusual in that they are entirely on his fringe - this is because he was born on a small island on Palaven which traditionally uses this pattern. At first glance many Turians believe Sindri to be barefaced, which has only strengthened Sindri's pride in his birthplace. The difficulties of being mistaken for barefaced are a major factor in solidifying his convictions.</p>"
				+ "<p>Sindri has a pierced left brow. He received these piercings during his time on Earth in an attempt to adopt some Human culture. He was also considerably drunk at the time.</p>"
				+ "<p>Sindri occasionally wore a cowboy hat while on Earth, something which he and his friends found amusing.</p>"
				+ "<p>Following his service on the PFS Brusco, Sindri does not wear armor. He instead wears standard Turian clothing well suited to outdoor work and whatever climate he is in.</p>",

			personality: "<h1>General Traits</h1>"
				+ "<p>Sindri is an unflinching optimist. While stranded with Dr. Alerius, Sindri refused to accept that they would never be rescued and maintained a cheerful demeanor. He is this way because he was raised an idealist, and he has become deeply anxious about the things wrong in the galaxy. Rather than face these realities, he tends to evade with unrealistic hopes and blind faith.</p>"
				+ "<p>Sindri is perpetually interested in the unknown and the different, often to the point of becoming enamored. He favors non-Turians in part because he does not face much chance of being mistaken for barefaced among them. He takes a deep interest in all life, and in the experiences of others. While he is eager to listen to stories, he is often overly hesitant to reveal much about himself.</p>"
				+ "<p>Sindri is an extrovert. He continually seeks out others to interact with and derives great pleasure from conversations. He is very sensitive to interpersonal conflict, and often steps in to resolve disputes among colleagues.</p>"
				+ "<p>Sindri is of strong conviction. While open to listening to others, Sindri is mostly convinced that his moral viewpoint is the absolute correct one. He is not afraid to stand up for what he believes at the expense of being diplomatic when lines are crossed - this is a result of the bullying he faced as a child.</p>"
				+ "<p>Sindri is relatively inexperienced with romantic relationships. While he has had a few boyfriends, Sindri is often too evasive about himself to form intimacy. He fears revealing too much about himself could possibly leave his ideals or his optimism open to refutation. This does not mean that he shies away from flirting or physical relationships. </p>"
				+ "<p>Sindri is a gambler. Taking risks thrills him, which often leads to irresponsible or unpredictable behavior.</p>"
				+ "<h1>Hobbies</h1>"
				+ "<p>Cooking. Working with plants has led Sindri to develop an interest in their culinary properties - and so he has become adept at incorporating exotic flora into delicious dishes.</p>"
				+ "<p>Exploring. Nothing gives Sindri a thrill like going where no one has gone before. Or at least where he hasn't gone before. This means he's inclined to go on hikes, exotic trips, and cultural exchanges.</p>"
				+ "<p>Alcohol. It's a vice of his - Sindri loves elaborate drinks. He finds the latest concoction of the local bartender impossible to resist - often to his later discomfort.</p>"
				+ "<p>Doodling. Sindri doesn't take art very seriously, but he does like to draw silly figures in his spare time. He often carries around a felt pen and doodles on either his notepad or - when no one is looking - some drab wall or door.</p>"
				+ "<p>Cuddling. Sindri loves non-sexual physical attention. The feeling of closeness is comforting to him.</p>"
				+ "<h1>Sexuality</h1>"
				+ "<p>Sindri is bisexual. In childhood he had fleeting romances with members of all genders, and since maturing has continued sexual interest in individuals regardless of gender. However, Sindri has stronger sexual desires with members of the male gender.</p>"
				+ "<p>Sindri is open to sexual experiences. He is particularly attracted to non-Turians.</p>"
				+ "<p>Sindri prefers partners at his age or older than he is - he tends to find younger partners uninteresting.</p>"
				+ "",

			backstory: "<h1>Milky Way (2159-2185)</h1>"
				+ "<p>Sindri Laelius was born on Palaven in 2159. His birthplace was a small island which traditionally uses an unusual tattoo pattern. This pattern, which is only on the fringe, often causes Sindri to be mistaken for barefaced, resulting in considerable bullying during Sindri's early life. Despite this difficulty, Sindri completed boot camp with high marks. His first assignment was in 2176 to the PFS Brusco, a Turian science vessel exploring the Terminus Systems. On The Brusco he served as a security officer, accompanying the ship's scientists to away missions. It was on these missions that Sindri became interested in plant science and was taken under the wing of the Brusco's biology team lead - Dr. Vadia Alerius.</p>"
				+ "<p>In 2178 a mission went terribly wrong; Sindri and Dr. Alerius found themselves the sole survivors of an away team. The Brusco, unable to retrieve them from the temperate planet's surface, was forced to depart. Dr. Alerius was injured, and Sindri worked under her direction to first forage, then cultivate, and finally selectively breed local flora for a food source. Two years later, in 2180, Sindri and Dr. Alerius were rescued by the MSV Seawolf, a Human vessel.</p>"
				+ "<p>Following their rescue, Sindri followed Vadia's advice to pursue a degree. Beginning school on Palaven, Sindri eagerly joined an exchange student program with Earth in his second semester. He had become fascinated with Humans following his rescue on the Seawolf, and he immersed himself in Human culture while studying. During his education, Sindri was required to visit several planets throughout the galaxy for case studies and research. In 2184 Sindri earned a master’s degree in plant sciences from UC Davis and returned to Palaven.</p>"
				+ "<p>Once again in service of the Hierarchy, Sindri was placed on Dr. Alerius's team at her request in early 2185. The team operated all across the galaxy but was moved by the Hierarchy and its needs rather than Dr. Alerius's research interests. For this reason, Dr. Alerius convinced her team to join the Andromeda Initiative aboard the Natanus later that year.</p>"
				+ "<h1>Andromeda (2819-)</h1>"
				+ "<p>Following the events of Mass Effect: Andromeda, Dr. Alerius' team is awakened from cryo-sleep. Supplied a new frigate by the initiative - the Wasp - they are let loose into the cluster to scout for new interesting floral life. Technically their primary goal is to find useful plants for cultivation by the Initiative, but their unofficial goal is to study local ecosystems and expand knowledge about how life works on the inter-galactic scale. Sindri is highly excited to begin this new phase of his life, and endless possibilities no doubt await....</p>",
